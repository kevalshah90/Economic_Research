### State Capacity vs Complexity 


The general assumption is that with strong state capacity and economic development, complex rules will be enforced. Epstein argues that this complexity imposed creates private, public and social costs.

'Simple rules for the developing world' paper argues that this insights holds true even for developing nations. Prematurely adopting complex rules with limited state capacity can actually reduce the ability of weak states to develop greater state capacity.

Empirical Task:

Countries with weak / poor state capacity and low regulatory complexity have better outcomes

vs

Countries with weak / poor state capacity and high regulatory complexity have poor outcomes.

We use the following measures:

Chong - Letter Grading Government Efficiency for State Capacity

World Bank's ease of doing business as measure for regulatory complexity. Additional measures also include: Ease of Starting a business, construction permits, Registering a property

Outcome is measured as GDP Per Capita

Other variables to consider (possible control variables):

Income per capita
Democracy Index
Communist
Population (predictor of complexity)
